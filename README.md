# Gen
Gen is a singleplayer, top down, retro, RPG. Based off of games such as Minecraft, Rimworld, Terraria, and NES/Gameboy Games.

# Goal
To create an experience that is unique to the user with user friendly interfaces and options to be able to add content easily
effectively without much programming experience from the user.

# Design Plans
Below is the features and a short description of each feature.

# Create Game Objects With Config File and Image
Gen will automatically generate game objects, items, and recipes with given config files and images. Gen uses special 'gcf' 
ending to define config files. The exact lay out and information of the gcf files are stated further down.

# Easy Animations
Gen, when loading images, will automatically check if the image is a vertical or horizontal strip of images. If the
image is a strip of images, then Gen will divide the image up and create animation out of it. The exact speed and 
frames can be set in the gcf file.

# Paint New Objects In Game
There may be the ability for the user to create new game objects by painting with an in game editor. The specifics
are not yet defined and this will be a later feature.

# The Ability To Share
Gen will allow the user to share their creations and world gens with other users so others can enjoy. This most 
like will be implemented with a folder share option or uploading to a Gen resource server.

# What is a gcf file?
A gcf file is a configuration file specific to Gen that defines a set of attributes for an object. Otherwise Gen
will generate attributes for the object.

# What is a gwf file?
A gwf file is a world save specific to Gen.
